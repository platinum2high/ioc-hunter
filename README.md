## 🌐 Try it in the browser — no install

A paste-and-check web demo lives at the public Render deployment.
Paste any text, get back verdicts in real time. No signup, no
data retention, the rendered code is the same engine you run
locally.

**Deploy your own** in two clicks: see [`Self-host the web demo`](#self-host-the-web-demo)
below.

## ⚡ Works keyless out of the box

You don't need any API keys to try it. Clone, install, run — **two
sources work immediately** with no signup:

- **Tor exit** — flags traffic from Tor relays
- **NetMeta** — offline classifier for bogon / private / CGNAT / reserved
  IP ranges (RFC 1918, RFC 5737, RFC 6598, RFC 6890). A `test-net` or
  `240/4` IP in a production log = misconfig or spoofed traffic.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platinum2high/ioc-hunter
cd ioc-hunter
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
ioc-hunter check "185[.]220[.]101[.]42"   # ← works right now, no key needed
```

For **the other five sources** (URLhaus, ThreatFox, AbuseIPDB, OTX,
VirusTotal) you need free API keys — they all register in under a minute
and the tool walks you through it with `ioc-hunter configure`. Without
them, those sources return `UNKNOWN` with a clear "missing API key"
message — they don't crash, just gracefully skip.

---

## What it does that other IOC tools don't

| Capability | Most IOC checkers | IOC Hunter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | one IOC at a time | drag in a whole report, paste `.eml`, or tail a live log |
| Defang-aware | usually no | `evil[.]com`, `hxxp://`, `[at]` all understood |
| Sources | 1 (usually VT) | 7 in parallel: VT, AbuseIPDB, OTX, URLhaus, ThreatFox, Tor exit, NetMeta |
| Phishing triage | none | `.eml` parser: From/Reply-To mismatch, Received chain, attachment hashes |
| Live monitoring | none | `watch` mode — tail a log, alert on suspicious IOCs in real time |
| Scoring | bad/good | transparent weighted model with per-source contribution |
| Output | terminal text | JSON, Markdown, **STIX 2.1**, **MISP**, **Sigma**, **Suricata** |
| Correlation | none | shared-subnet + shared-tag pivots across the batch |
| Decoding | none | base64 / hex / URL / JWT / gzip / zlib + magic auto-detect |
| Cache | none | SQLite with TTL — survives across runs, doesn't burn API quota |

---

## Install

### 1. Clone and create a virtualenv

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platinum2high/ioc-hunter
cd ioc-hunter
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install the package

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This pulls in 4 runtime dependencies (`httpx`, `typer`, `rich`,
`python-dotenv`) and gives you the `ioc-hunter` command in your shell.

### 3. (Optional) Add API keys

You can skip this and the tool still works — only the Tor-exit feed
will run. To unlock the other 5 feeds, all free:

| Source | Register | Adds support for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **abuse.ch Auth-Key** (URLhaus + ThreatFox) | <https://auth.abuse.ch/> | URLs, domains, IPs, hashes, emails |
| **AbuseIPDB** | <https://www.abuseipdb.com/register> | IPv4/IPv6 reputation |
| **AlienVault OTX** | <https://otx.alienvault.com/> | IPs, domains, URLs, hashes, CVEs |
| **VirusTotal** | <https://www.virustotal.com/> | IPs, domains, URLs, hashes |

Registration on each is ~30 seconds. Then run the interactive setup:

```bash
ioc-hunter configure
```

It walks through each key with the registration URL, writes a local
`.env` (gitignored), leaves untouched keys alone.

### 4. Verify the install

```bash
ioc-hunter sources
```

![ioc-hunter sources](docs/screenshots/sources.svg)

Sources marked `missing key` would show as yellow and skip with a clear
message at runtime — not crash. You can run with as few as one (the
keyless Tor feed).

---

## Run it with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env             # fill in any keys you have
docker compose run --rm ioc-hunter check evil[.]com
```

The image is multi-stage (non-root runtime, ~120 MB), the SQLite cache is
mounted as a volume so it survives across containers.

---

## Commands

```
ioc-hunter check <ioc>                       single IOC verdict
ioc-hunter scan-file <path>                  extract + enrich every IOC in a file
ioc-hunter parse-eml <path>                  phishing .eml — headers, body, attachments
ioc-hunter watch <path>                      tail a log file and alert on suspicious IOCs
ioc-hunter correlate <path>                  shared-infra and shared-tag pivots
ioc-hunter report <path> --format <fmt>      json | md | stix | misp | sigma | suricata
ioc-hunter decode <text> [--op <name>]       base64 / hex / URL / JWT / gzip / ... (magic by default)
ioc-hunter sources                           list configured sources
ioc-hunter configure                         interactive .env wizard
```

Global flags: `--version`, `--help`. Per-command: `--no-cache` for fresh
lookups.

---

## Demo with real output

### Single IOC — defanged in, defanged out

```bash
ioc-hunter check "185[.]220[.]101[.]42" --no-cache
```

![ioc-hunter check](docs/screenshots/check.svg)

That's a real Tor exit relay — flagged by 4 of 6 sources, with country,
ISP, and attack-pattern tags. Confidence is shown explicitly so you can
defend the verdict in a ticket.

### Scan a whole report

`examples/sample-incident.txt` is included in the repo:

```bash
ioc-hunter scan-file examples/sample-incident.txt --no-cache
```

![ioc-hunter scan-file](docs/screenshots/scan-file.svg)

Note: every IOC is **defanged on output** so you can't accidentally
click `evil.com` from your terminal. They were also defanged on input
(`185[.]220[.]101[.]42`, `hxxps://`, `bad[at]evil[.]com`) — refanging
is automatic.

### Triage a phishing `.eml`

```bash
ioc-hunter parse-eml suspicious.eml
```

![ioc-hunter parse-eml](docs/screenshots/parse-eml.svg)

The envelope panel flags **Reply-To ≠ From** and surfaces
**X-Originating-IP** explicitly — both classic phishing tells.
The Received chain reveals the real MTA hops. Attachments are
hashed (SHA-256 + MD5) and their hashes flow straight into the TI
lookups along with body URLs, header IPs, and quoted domains.

Add `--no-enrich` for an offline-only parse (no TI calls).

### Watch a log file live

```bash
ioc-hunter watch /var/log/auth.log --threshold suspicious
```

![ioc-hunter watch](docs/screenshots/watch.svg)

Tail-style polling with log-rotation handling (inode change or truncate
re-opens from the start). Bursts are debounced — a thousand-line spike
becomes one batched TI lookup, not a thousand. Alerts only fire for
verdicts at or above the configured threshold.

### Find cross-IOC pivots

```bash
ioc-hunter correlate examples/sample-incident.txt --no-cache
```

![ioc-hunter correlate](docs/screenshots/correlate.svg)

### Generate detection rules

```console
$ ioc-hunter report examples/sample-incident.txt --format sigma --no-cache

```

Same input also exports as `--format suricata`, `--format stix`,
`--format misp`, `--format json`, `--format markdown`.

### Magic decode

```bash
ioc-hunter decode "aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmlsLmNvbS9sb2dpbi5waHA="
```

![ioc-hunter decode](docs/screenshots/decode.svg)

The base64 candidate ranks first because the decoded text contains
extractable IOCs — IOC presence is a tiebreaker in the scoring.

Force a specific op: `--op base64`, `--op hex`, `--op url`, `--op jwt`,
`--op gzip`, `--op zlib`, `--op rot13`, `--op html`, `--op base32`.

---

## Self-host the web demo

The repo ships a FastAPI front (`src/ioc_hunter/web/`) and a Render
`render.yaml` Blueprint. Free tier is fine for a portfolio demo —
the dyno sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity and wakes on the
next request (~30 s cold start).

### Run it locally

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"
uvicorn ioc_hunter.web:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# → http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploy to Render in 5 clicks

1. Push this repo to your GitHub.
2. <https://dashboard.render.com/> → **New +** → **Blueprint**.
3. Pick the `ioc-hunter` repo. Render auto-discovers `render.yaml`.
4. Click **Apply**. The Free service builds from `Dockerfile.web`.
5. *(Optional)* In the service → **Environment**, set any TI API
   keys you have (`ABUSE_CH_AUTH_KEY`, `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`,
   `OTX_API_KEY`, `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`). Without them, the
   keyless sources (NetMeta + Tor exit) still work.

Every push to `main` redeploys automatically. Health endpoint at
`/healthz`, API docs at `/api/docs`.

### Built-in safety

- Hard rate limit (10 req/min per IP, configurable via env)
- Body cap (64 KB), text cap (32 KB), max 25 IOCs per scan
- No IOC retention — request data leaves no trace beyond the
  in-process cache, keyed by source/type/value only
- Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy`)
- Trusts only the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` value (Render's edge)
  for rate-limit bucketing — defeats trivial header spoofing

## TI Sources

| Source | Auth | Supports | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| URLhaus (abuse.ch) | Auth-Key (free) | URL, domain, IPv4, MD5, SHA256 | 0.85 |
| ThreatFox (abuse.ch) | Auth-Key (free) | URL, domain, IP, hashes, email | 0.85 |
| AbuseIPDB | API key (free 1k/day) | IPv4, IPv6 | 0.80 |
| AlienVault OTX | API key (free) | IPv4, IPv6, domain, URL, file, CVE | 0.75 |
| VirusTotal | API key (free 4/min) | IPv4, IPv6, domain, URL, file | 0.90 |
| Tor exit list | **none** | IPv4, IPv6 | 0.40 |
| NetMeta (offline) | **none** | IPv4, IPv6 | 0.20 |

Adding a source is one file: subclass `Source`, implement `async lookup()`,
import in `sources/__init__.py`. See `sources/tor_exit.py` for the
shortest possible example (40 lines).

| 3 — keyless TI sources | ✅ |
| 4 — keyed TI sources | ✅ |
| 5 — async engine + scorer | ✅ |
| 6 — CLI + Rich TUI | ✅ |
| 7 — JSON / Markdown / STIX / MISP exporters | ✅ |
| 8 — correlation graph | ✅ |
| 9 — Sigma / Suricata rule generation | ✅ |
| 10 — CyberChef-style decoder | ✅ |
| 11 — Docker, CI, README | ✅ |
| 12 — .eml parser, watch-mode, NetMeta source | ✅ |
| 13 — FastAPI web demo + Render Blueprint | ✅ |

**263 tests, all green.** CI runs the full matrix (Python 3.11 + 3.12),
Docker build, `ruff` lint + format check, and `gitleaks` secret scan on
every push.

---

## Security

API keys live in `.env`, which is gitignored. `gitleaks` runs on every
push to catch accidents. The Dockerfile builds a non-root runtime image.

If you find a vulnerability, please open a private security advisory
rather than a public issue.
